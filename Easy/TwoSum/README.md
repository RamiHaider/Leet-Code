# TwoSum Problem

- **'FullNotesTwoSum.ipynb'**: Contains the Jupyter Notebooks document that contains markdown explaining the time complexity and some theory of both the brute force method implementing nested-loop and the hashing method (otherwise known as a dictionary).
- **'TwoSumBruteForce.py'**: Brute Force Method that is O(n^2). Mind you, it works in Leet Code, but in Jupyter it may run into problems, and I'm unsure why
- **'TwoSumHashing.py'**: Using Dictionary. This method is O(n). Mind you, it beats 97% of all previous LeetCoders.
